## Getting Started
_Note: this includes instructions for recreating your own version of this project.  For use as a demo at ACT-W 2017._

##### Prereqs:
> This assumes you have *Node version >=6* already installed. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#usage) to install or update your Node version)

> If you have never used git, you can use [these instructions](http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/first_time.html) after creating a github account before setting up your first repo.

1. Create a new `create-react-app` project
```sh
npm install -g create-react-app

create-react-app my-app
cd my-app/
npm start // run the app
```
2. Create a github repo for your project.
  * Log into your github account, go to https://github.com/new and enter the name of the folder you just created (`my-app` in the example above).
  * Do not create a README since this already exists as generated by `create-react-app`
3. Initialize the git repo within your project directory.
```sh
git init
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/jjarz/my-app.git // replace with URL for your git repo
git push -u origin master
```
